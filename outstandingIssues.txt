ISSUES needing solving

Loop through the json file so that only the expected results are shown on each page. This is mainly for the information pages
Include Phone numbers, email address that are contactable when clicked on each information page ie. depression, anxiety, eating etc . This has to be done on the useful contacts aswell
Populate an icon with each number & contact details - ion icons should work
Give the user the ability to ring KYSS and the samaritans on the home page. We can copy and paste this functionality to the side menu for the Samaritans

If you get one or two of the contact details working and the loops, just get it sorted on one and send it back to me and I will fill in everything and then at least we can both sit down and do the deployment
